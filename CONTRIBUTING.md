We love pull requests.  Here is a quick guide:

1. Check for [existing issues](https://github.com/TaleLearnCode/SonarCloud.NET/issues) for duplicates and confirm that it has not already been fixed in the [main branch](https://github.com/TaleLearnCode/SonarCloud.NET/commits/main).
1. Fork the repo and clone it locally
1. Create a new branch for your contribution
1. Add [tests](tests/)
1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you are waiting on us.  We like to at least comment on, if not accept, pull requests within a few days.  We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- Make sure the tests pass
- Update the documentation: code comments, example code, guides. Basically, update everything updated by your contribution.
- Include any information that would be relevant to reproducing bugs, use cases for new features, etc.
- If the change does break compatibility, how can it be updated to become backwards compatible, while directing user to the new way of doing things?
- Your commits are associated with your GitHub user: https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user/
- Make pull requests against a feature branch
